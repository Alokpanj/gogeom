```
This is a Geometrical library for Go Language.
Which includes multiple Geometrical calculations like Circle, Lines etc in different forms.
```
## Installation

Installation is done using `go get`.
```
go get -u github.com/MindorksOpenSource/gogeom
```



#### These are following shape calculation which is supported by gogeom.
- [x] Circle
- [x] Line
- [x] Ellipse
- [ ] more to come..

# Circle
gogeom can handle two form of Circle.
- **Radius Form** 
  ``` 
  (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2 
  where,
  (a,b) is the center and "r" is the radius of the circle
  ``` 
- **General Form**
  ```
  x2 + y2 + Ax + By+ C = 0
  where,
  A,B and C are real numbers
  ```
#### Step to follow :


- import `geometry "github.com/MindorksOpenSource/gogeom"`
- Initalize two circles as (in Radius Form),
```
import geometry "github.com/MindorksOpenSource/gogeom"

func main() {
    // (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2 and (x-c)^2 + (y-d)^2 = s^2  are circle equation
    // r, s are radius of two circles
r := geometry.RadiusFormCircle{
        // a, b , r , c, d, s
        2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
	}
}
```
-  Initalize two circles as (in General Form),
```
import `geometry "github.com/MindorksOpenSource/gogeom"

func main() {
// x2 + y2 + Ax + By+ C = 0 and  x2 + y2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0 are circle equation
g := geometry.GeneralFormOfCircle{
        // a, b , r , c, d, s
        2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
	}
}

```

# Line
gogeom can handle two form of Line.
- **General Form** 
  ``` 
  Ax+By+C =0
  where A, B and C are any real number and A and B are not both zero.``` 
- **Two Point Form**
  ```
  (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) form two lines passing through it
  ```

  #### Step to follow :


- import `geometry "github.com/MindorksOpenSource/gogeom"`
- Initalize two lines as (in **General** Form),
```
// initialise one line 
l := geometry.GeneralLine{
        // a, b, c
        2, 3, 4,
	}
}

---- or if you have to initialise multiple line ----
l := geometry.GeneralLines{
        // a, b, c, d, e, f
        2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
	}
}
---- or if you have two point line ----
l := geometry.GeneralLines{
        // a, b, c, d, e, f
        2, 3, 4, 5, 
	}
}

```
- Initalize two lines as (in **Two Point Form Line** Form),

(center at   x = 0   y = 0)
```       
 #### Step to follow :


- import `geometry "github.com/MindorksOpenSource/gogeom"`
- Initalize ellipse,
```
e := geometry.Ellipse {
        // a, b
        1,2
}
